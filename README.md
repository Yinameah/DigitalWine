## DigitalWine

A frappe app to deal with wine maker needs.

It implement a "comptabilit√© de cave" and some tools to link it to items (i.e. the wine bottles)

## Note

This is developed for pretty specific needs.

I don't really expect this to be useful to other people. I don't develop this to be plug and play.

However, if you think that you could make use of it, cool ! I don't really have much time to support, but I would be happy to **Get in touch !**

More specifically, if you are in **Wallis / Switzerland**, then we should absolutely have a drink.

## Status

Nothing is working. Just a Proof of concept stage, sadly ;-(
